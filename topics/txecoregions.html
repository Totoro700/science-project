			<h2 style="margin: 100px 0px 100px 0px; font-size: 45px; text-align: center;">In-depth explaination of each ecoregion</h2>
			<h3 id="rp">Rolling Plains</h3>
			<p>Approximately one-third of the region is used for agriculture with a variety of different crops such as wheat, and cotton. Soils in Rolling Plains vary from fine sand to clays. Limestone ridges and steep terrains offer greater woody plant diversity and habitat for a diversity of wildlife species.</p>
			<h3 id="hp">High Plains</h3>
			<p>High Plains region covers about 39,500 square miles in north Texas. High Plains region's estimated total population was 872,000 (2019)</p>
			<h3 id="ep">Edwards Plateau</h3>
			<p>The Edwards Plateau is an elevated region made from ocean deposits millions of years ago. The western portion remains a relatively flat elevated plateau whereas the eastern portion known as the Hill Country is deeply eroded. The land supports a rich diversity of grasses and other plants.</p>
			<h3 id="stp">South Texas Plains</h3>
			<p>The South Texas plains and brush country stretches from the edges of the Hill Country into the subtropical regions of the Lower Rio Grande valley. The South Texas Plains is dry and covered with grasses and thorny brush such as mesquite and prickly pear cacti</p>
			<h3 id="gpm">Gulf Prairies and Marshes</h3>
			<p>A narrow band about 60 miles wide along the Texas coast from the Louisiana border to Brownsville roughly outlines the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes. This area is characterized by long and continual confrontations with the sea, wind and rain.</p>
			<h3 id="pop">Post Oak Savannah</h3>
			<p>The Post Oak Savannah landscapes were formed and maintained by two major forces: frequent fire and grazing of bison. Fires ignited either by lightning or humans (American Indian) were the major force that molded the prairie and savannah landscapes. One of the earliest uses of the Post Oak Savannah by early settlers was grazing livestock, primarily cattle and horses. Farming was also common but did not become a major use until the 1870's</p>
			<h3 id="pw">Piney Woods</h3>
			<p>This region mainly contains a thick forest of pine trees. Trees in this region mostly include loblolly pine, blackjack oak, and post oak. Swamps are common in the southern part of this region. The climate is usually warm and humid.</p>
			<h3 id="bp">Blackland Prairies</h3>
			<p>The Blackland Prairie is a prairie grassland regiony which contains a diverse assortment grasses and rich soil (soil with a lot nutrients). Pecan, cedar elm, various oaks and hackberry live in this region with some mesquite growing into the southern parts.</p>
			<h3 id="ct">Cross Timbers</h3>
			<p>This regino is made up of a mix of prairies, savannas, and woodlands. The Cross Timbers contain millions of 200-400 year-old post oaks, trees predating the birth of our nation and which had already lived for a century or more.</p>
			<h3 id="tp">Trans-Pecos</h3>
			<p>The Trans-Pecos region is the only part of Texas where mountain and desert habitats are found. This amazing region contains at least 268 grass species and 447 species of woody plants. Research shows that the Trans-Pecos region was once covered by a mesic woodland about 11 thousand years ago.</p>
