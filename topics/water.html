			<p>The water cycle is the movement of water on Earth. It starts as normal liquid water on the ground. As the heat from the sun reaches the water, it evaporates creating water vapor. Since the water vapor is lighter than air, it rises. The air high up is colder than normal, so the water vapor cools down turning into clouds. As clouds get denser and denser with more liquid water, it starts raining or depending on the conditions, hailing, snowing etc. The <b><a href="../keywords.html#precipitation">precipitation</a></b> gets stored in a <b><a href="../keywords.html#watershed">watershed</a></b> where it may evaporate again later.</p>
