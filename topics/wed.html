			<p id="weathering">Weathering is the breaking down of rocks. This can happen <b>physically</b> and <b>chemically</b>. Physically can happen when precipitation like water, snow, and hail break down the rock. Chemically can happen when substances break down the rock like water and limestone reacting and breaking down.</p>
